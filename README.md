# Udacity Deep Learning

Earlier in 2020, I was greatful to be chosen as one of the recipients for Bertelsmann Technology Scholarship. This scholarship has enabled me to start on my journey with Artificial Intelligence track and complete [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).   


This is a Code repository for some projects that I completed as part of the Nanodegree and some summary to review. The curriculum is so well-designed that I can complete my projects without much trouble after watching all the course videos. On the other hand, the TAs are always available and supportive to help me whenever I encounter any issue.
