# LESSON 1. GAN

## How GAN works
- Historical: use autoregressive model to generate one pixel at a time
- GAN try to recreate the whole image

## Games and Equilibria 
- Based on game theory
  - Each agent can have a choice of action
  - If each player choose at random -> equilibrium where all players can't improve their strategy
  
## Tips for training GANS
- Both models have at least a hidden layer and can represent any probability distribution if given enough hidden units
- For discriminator: leaky Rely is popuplar to have the gradient flow through the whole architecture
- For generator: popular choice for output is Hyperbolic tangent
- The output of the model has to be a probability
