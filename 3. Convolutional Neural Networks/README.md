This Unit covers:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks
What CNN is about, the definition, the model.
CNN allow for spatial pattern recoginition. Different layers will identify different patterns.

2. Cloud Computing
Take advantage of Amazon's GPUs to train your neural network faster.

3. Transfer Learning
Learn how to apply a pre-trained network to a new problem with transfer learning. Different ways of Transfer Learning in different situation


4. Weight Initialization
How to find good initial weights for a neural network. Having good initial weights can place the neural network closer to the optimal solution
